## About Me
Hello! I'm Abhika, a passionate computer science student deeply committed to advancing the field of artificial intelligence (AI) with a focus on Natural Language Processing (NLP). As an Undergraduate Researcher at the University of Washington, I explore innovative approaches to enhance language models' trustworthiness and quality, particularly in detecting hallucinations within LM outputs. I am excited to contribute my skills and insights to the ever-evolving landscape of ethical and transformative technology.
