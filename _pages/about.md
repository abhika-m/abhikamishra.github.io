Hello! I'm Abhika, a passionate computer science student deeply committed to advancing the field of artificial intelligence (AI) with a focus on Natural Language Processing (NLP). As an Undergraduate Researcher at the University of Washington, I explore innovative approaches to enhance language models' trustworthiness and quality, particularly in detecting hallucinations within LM outputs. Alongside my academic pursuits, I've led impactful projects like CropUp, promoting sustainable agriculture, and SoundScribe, an AI-powered healthcare application. My journey revolves around harnessing AI for social good, and I am excited to contribute my skills and insights to the ever-evolving landscape of ethical and transformative technology.
